# Acrolinx Java SDK

This library is meant to be used to interact with the Acrolinx Platform API in Java integrations. 
It does NOT offer an interface to work with the Acrolinx Sidebar (see [Sidebar Java SDK](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-java)).

## How to start

Have a look at [AcrolinxEndpoint](./src/main/java/com/acrolinx/client/sdk/AcrolinxEndpoint.java) and use it.

## Integration tests

In order to run the integration tests:
* You need an Acrolinx server
* You need to create an .env file similar to the [.env.template](.env.template) file. Alternately you can set the corresponding env variables in a different way.
